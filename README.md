## Summary

### 1. Domain
Connecting people who are eager to practice or refine their second language skills with those who are fluent in particular languages. More specifically people are looking to be connected with similar interests in languages who do not have a medium available.

### 2. Target Users
i. Language learners (18 years +) who are attempting to connect them with native speakers in order to refine their language skills.

ii. Fluent speakers who willingly volunteer to be conversation partners for language learners

### 3. Problem Statement
“Design an online platform application to support comfortable and motivational second language communication practice with native speakers by language learners.”

### 4. Product: GENGO
i. "Gengo” connects language learners and fluent speakers for one-on-one setting communication practice in a particular language. 

ii. “Gengo” has a filter function to let language learners choose their conversation partners based on their preferences 

iii. “Gengo” provides a medium for texting, voice message, and video call as communication options.

iv. “Gengo” has a chatbot character to motivate learners by reminding them of their learning purposes every day, and support the conversation when necessary.

## Process
### 1. Overal Process

__Background Research__          →  Determined to focus on conversation aspect 

▼   - Domain Research 

▼   - Existing Solutions                

▼   - Expert Interview 


__User Research__      → Identified Challenges

▼   - Interview for language learners

▼   - Academic research on language learners    



__First Prototype (low-fidelity)__      → Determined basic functions

▼   - User testing for the communication method

▼   - User testing for pair matching    

▼   - Academic research to support the findings   



__Second Prototype (high-fidelity-1__     → Improved Usability

▼   - User testing for usability



__Final Prototype (high-fidelity-2)__ → Future design direction


### 2. Background & User Research
Academic studies: [LINK](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/keizai/blob/master/Academic%20Studies).

Existing solutions: [LINK]().

User research & Expert interview: [LINK]().


- Main findings to support our design decision: See “Background” section in the poster
- Main challenges identified through the research above:

  i. Let learners communicate with native speakers (including all of the reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills) and let them use the language as a tool for communication
  
  ii. Provide an environment for learners apart from other language learners
  
  iii. Provide a comfortable environment for learners to communicate 
  
  iv. Encourage learners to keep learning through the social network system
